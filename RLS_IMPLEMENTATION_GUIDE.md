# RLS Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) implementation for the SOP Manager application. RLS has been successfully implemented on all critical tables to ensure data security and proper access control.

## Current Status

### âœ… Successfully Implemented Tables

All tables now have comprehensive RLS policies:

1. **invite_codes** - 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
2. **departments** - 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
3. **user_profiles** - 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
4. **user_departments** - 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
5. **sops** - 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
6. **sop_steps** - 4 policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### ðŸ”’ Security Features

- **Department Isolation**: Users only see data from their departments
- **Role-Based Access**: Superadmins have full access to all data
- **User Ownership**: Users can only modify their own profiles
- **SOP Protection**: Users can only access SOPs from their departments
- **Invite Security**: Only superadmins can manage invite codes

## Testing Environment

### RLS Test Environment

A comprehensive testing environment is available for SuperAdmins:

1. **Access**: SuperAdmin â†’ RLS Test Environment
2. **Function**: Tests all RLS policies on production tables
3. **Features**:
   - Single "Run All Tests" button
   - Visual test results with pass/fail indicators
   - Copy results to clipboard for debugging
   - Tests SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations

### How to Use

1. **Navigate**: Go to SuperAdmin panel â†’ RLS Test Environment
2. **Run Tests**: Click "Run All Tests" button
3. **Review Results**: Check visual indicators for each table
4. **Copy Results**: Click "Copy Test Results" to get debugging data
5. **Debug**: Paste results in chat for assistance

## Policy Details

### invite_codes
- **SELECT**: Anyone can view (for invite validation)
- **INSERT**: Authenticated users only
- **UPDATE/DELETE**: Superadmins only

### departments
- **SELECT**: Anyone can view
- **INSERT**: Authenticated users only
- **UPDATE/DELETE**: Superadmins only

### user_profiles
- **SELECT**: All authenticated users (critical for login)
- **INSERT**: Users can only create their own profile
- **UPDATE**: Users can only update their own profile
- **DELETE**: Superadmins only

### user_departments
- **SELECT**: Users see their own memberships + superadmins see all
- **INSERT**: Authenticated users only
- **UPDATE/DELETE**: Superadmins only

### sops
- **SELECT**: Users see SOPs from their departments + superadmins see all
- **INSERT**: Users can create SOPs in their departments
- **UPDATE**: Users can update SOPs in their departments + superadmins
- **DELETE**: Superadmins only

### sop_steps
- **SELECT**: Users see steps from their department's SOPs + superadmins see all
- **INSERT**: Users can create steps in their department's SOPs
- **UPDATE**: Users can update steps in their department's SOPs + superadmins
- **DELETE**: Superadmins only

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback RLS (Emergency Only)

If RLS causes critical issues, use this emergency script:

```sql
-- EMERGENCY: Disable all RLS
ALTER TABLE invite_codes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE departments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_departments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sops DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sop_steps DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Re-enable RLS

To re-enable RLS after rollback:

```sql
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE invite_codes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE departments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_departments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sops ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sop_steps ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Testing

1. **Weekly**: Run RLS Test Environment to verify all policies
2. **After Updates**: Test RLS after any database schema changes
3. **New Features**: Test RLS when adding new tables or functionality

### Debugging Process

1. **Identify Issue**: Use RLS Test Environment to identify failing policies
2. **Copy Results**: Use "Copy Test Results" button to get debugging data
3. **Analyze**: Review the JSON results to understand the problem
4. **Fix**: Update policies or data as needed
5. **Re-test**: Run tests again to verify the fix

### Common Issues

1. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensure test data uses valid foreign keys
2. **Unique Constraints**: Handle unique constraint violations in test data
3. **Department Access**: Verify users have proper department memberships
4. **Superadmin Status**: Check if user has superadmin privileges

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Audit Logging**: Track RLS policy violations
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor RLS impact on query performance
3. **Policy Templates**: Create reusable policy templates for new tables
4. **Automated Testing**: Integrate RLS tests into CI/CD pipeline

### Adding New Tables

When adding new tables that need RLS:

1. **Design Policies**: Plan the access control requirements
2. **Test Environment**: Add the table to RLS Test Environment
3. **Implement Policies**: Create the RLS policies
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use RLS Test Environment to verify
5. **Document**: Update this guide with new table details

## Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum access needed
2. **Department Isolation**: Users only see their department's data
3. **Superadmin Oversight**: Only superadmins can manage system-wide settings
4. **Regular Auditing**: Monitor access patterns and policy effectiveness
5. **Emergency Procedures**: Always have rollback procedures ready

## Conclusion

The RLS implementation provides comprehensive security while maintaining application functionality. The testing environment ensures ongoing reliability and provides tools for debugging and maintenance.

For questions or issues, use the RLS Test Environment to gather debugging information and consult this guide for resolution procedures.
