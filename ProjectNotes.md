# 2024-Refactor: Role & Department System Restoration

## Summary of Fixes (June 2024)

**Major issues with the role, department, and permission system were fully resolved with a robust, modern React + Supabase architecture.**

### Key Fixes
- **Centralized State:** All user, department, and role state is now managed in `useUserState.js`. No duplicate state in `App.jsx` or elsewhere.
- **Supabase Query Robustness:** The hook attempts a join for department names, but falls back to two queries if the foreign key is missing. This prevents schema errors and ensures department names always load.
- **No Fallbacks:** The current role is always sourced from Supabase, never defaulted to `'look'` or any fallback.
- **Role Button System:** Role buttons in `Header.jsx` use a loading state, update the role in Supabase, and reflect changes in the UI. Errors are shown if updates fail.
- **SuperAdmin Panel:** Always visible if `userProfile.is_superadmin === true`, regardless of department selection.
- **Permission Utilities:** All permission button visibility is determined by `getVisibleButtons(role)` and `isButtonVisible(button, role)` from `permissions.js`.
- **Debug Helpers:** `window.debugState()` exposes all relevant state and a `changeRole` function for console testing.
- **Error Handling:** All async operations have robust error and loading state management.

### Architecture Changes
- **Single Source of Truth:** Only `useUserState` manages user/department/role state. All components consume this hook.
- **Supabase Query Fallback:** If the schema does not support a join, the hook fetches department names separately.
- **UI Consistency:** All role/permission UI is driven by the current state from the hook, ensuring consistency and reliability.
- **Debugging:** Developers can inspect and mutate state from the browser console for rapid testing.

### TODOs / Improvements
- [ ] Add more granular error toasts for user feedback (currently only error banners)
- [ ] Add E2E tests for role/department switching and permission UI
- [ ] Consider React Context for global user/department state if more components need access
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates for role changes
- [ ] Audit all SOP-related components to ensure they use permission utilities for button visibility

### Supabase Foreign Key Constraint (2024-06)

A foreign key constraint was added to ensure robust department joins:

```sql
-- Rollback/guard: Drop if exists
ALTER TABLE user_departments
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS user_departments_department_id_fkey;

-- Add the correct foreign key (assuming departments.department_id is PK)
ALTER TABLE user_departments
ADD CONSTRAINT user_departments_department_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (department_id)
REFERENCES departments(department_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

If your PK is `departments.id`, change the reference to `departments(id)`.

### Corrected Fetch Query

The fetch for user departments now uses:
```js
.from('user_departments')
.select('department_id, role, departments:department_id(name)')
.eq('user_id', session.user.id)
```
This only works if the foreign key exists. If not, the code falls back to fetching department names separately.

### Error Handling & Fallback
- All fetches are wrapped in try/catch.
- If the join fails, a fallback fetch is used.
- If both fail, the UI will not break, but department names will be omitted.
- All errors are logged clearly in the console for debugging.

### UI & Role-Based Rendering Fixes (2024-06)
- **Panel visibility is now strictly role-gated:**
  - AdminPanel only renders if `activePanel === 'admin'` and user is Admin or SuperAdmin.
  - SuperAdminPanel only renders if `userProfile.is_superadmin === true`.
  - Panels never leak onto the Library or other views.
- **Role buttons in Header:**
  - Only show up to 'manage' (no 'super' button).
  - Buttons reflect current view role and provide feedback via console logs.
  - Role switching is local unless SuperAdmin.
- **Rogue UI elements like 'super' button have been removed** from all selectors and enums.
- **New SOP button is restored and working:**
  - Sets up blank SOP state and opens the Wizard.
  - Console log confirms initialization.
- **Centralized helpers** are used for all role/panel logic, avoiding duplicated conditionals.
- **Console logs** are present for all panel switches, role changes, and SOP creation for easy validation.

### Wizard.jsx Crash Fix & SOP Prop Contract (2024-06)
- **Wizard.jsx now requires a valid `sop` object with a `.steps` array.**
- All `.steps`, `.steps.length`, and `.steps.map` accesses are robustly guarded.
- If `sop` or `sop.steps` is missing/invalid, Wizard logs a warning and renders a fallback UI instead of crashing.
- Parent components (e.g., App.jsx) must always pass a valid `sop` object, even for new SOP creation (e.g., `{ name: '', description: '', tags: [], steps: [] }`).
- Debug logs are present for both valid and invalid cases.
- This future-proofs Wizard against undefined props and incomplete SOP state.

# SOP Manager Project Documentation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Concepts
The SOP Manager is a standalone web application built to manage Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) across departments. It uses a department-centric model where:

- **Departments** are the primary organizational units
- **Users** can belong to multiple departments with different roles
- **SOPs** are owned by departments and inherit their access controls
- **Roles** follow a progressive permission model
- **Super Admins** have cross-department management capabilities and are the sole source of user management

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase
- **State Management**: React Context + Local State
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Department-Centric Model**
   - Departments are the primary unit of organization
   - Users can have different roles in different departments
   - SOPs belong to departments, not individual users
   - Permissions are managed at the department level

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   ```
   Look   ‚Üí Read-only access to SOPs
   Tweak  ‚Üí Can suggest changes to SOPs
   Build  ‚Üí Can create and edit SOPs + all lower permissions
   Admin  ‚Üí Can manage department users and SOPs + all lower permissions
   Super  ‚Üí Cross-department management + all permissions
   ```

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Each role includes all permissions of lower roles
   - Role checks cascade down (e.g., Build includes Look and Tweak)
   - Super Admin is a special role with cross-department access

4. **Optimistic UI Updates**
   - Changes are reflected immediately in UI
   - Background sync with error handling
   - Loading states for all async operations
   - Clear error feedback on failures

   - created_by (UUID, FK to auth.users)
   - is_default (boolean)
   - created_at (timestamp)
   - metadata (jsonb)
   ```

2. **user_profiles**
   ```sql
   - user_id (UUID, PK)

## 2024 Overhaul Plan & Known Issues

### Navigation & State
- Manual syncing of `activePanel` and `window.location.hash` is fragile and causes infinite loops or view reverts.
- State is sometimes duplicated (e.g., `activePanel` in state and in hash), leading to bugs.
- Solution: Move to React Router, centralize navigation logic, and use a single source of truth for navigation.

### Permissions
- Permission checks are scattered across components, making it easy to miss a check or use the wrong one.
- Solution: Centralize permission logic in `permissions.js` and `useRoleBasedUI.js`.

### Error Handling
- Errors are often silent or only logged, making it hard to debug permission issues.
- Solution: Add user-facing error banners and robust error handling.

### Component Structure
- Some components (e.g., `App.jsx`, `Header.jsx`) do too much, making them hard to reason about.
- Solution: Break up large components, use container/presenter patterns, and keep logic focused.

### SOP Edit Flow
- The architecture supports reviewing an SOP in wizard mode for editing: when a user with permission clicks "Edit" on a SOP, the SOP is loaded into the Wizard component, which allows editing and saving back to Supabase. This is handled by `handleEditSop` in App.jsx, which sets `isEditing` and `editSopId`, and switches the panel to "wizard" with the current SOP loaded.

### Overhaul Steps
- Adopt React Router for navigation.
- Centralize all navigation logic in a router context/provider.
- Keep all user/department/role state in `useUserState` (or context).
- Remove duplicate/derived state.
- All permission checks must use helpers from `permissions.js` and `useRoleBasedUI`.
- Add user-facing error banners for all Supabase errors.
- Break up App.jsx into smaller containers (SOPManager, AdminManager, etc.).
- Add error boundaries and a debug panel for state inspection.
- Add E2E and unit tests for all critical flows.
